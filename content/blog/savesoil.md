SaveSoil aims to raise awareness on the most overlooked, but the most important aspect of climate change and all global warming issues. You do not have to look up at the sky, north pole, rivers, oceans, beaches. It's in the land where we live and grow our food on. 
Most parts of the lands are used for growing food - agriculture or animal husbandry. 70% of US land is used for agriculture or animal husbandry. And, the state of these are very grim. 

SaveSoil is a peaceful event with happiness in their events. 

If enough people show their support, then the politiicans are assured to make a long term plan. Right now, the most important problem with Democratic leaders is that the leaders are not looking into a long term future. They see that to win elections they should only keep their taxes low and represent the voices of the majority. So, the voices of citizens are very important.
